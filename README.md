# GridGames

GridGames is a compilation of grid based games built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) framework. This is currently an hobby project for learning about game dev and having fun building games

## Getting Started

To run any games from this repo you don't need to have lua installed separately. Having LÖVE game engine installed is enough. You can download LÖVE from [here](https://love2d.org/#download).

Once you have installed LÖVE for your operation system, you can add LÖVE's installed path to your PATH variable. Then, you can run any game using the command: `love <game_directory>`
